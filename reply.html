<h1>Thank you for your response</h1>

<h3>To talk about the website and app I designed lately, I'll divide it into three parts</h3><br>

<br>
<strong style="font-family: Montserrat;">1. The website for my database project</strong>
<p style="font-family: Roboto Slab; margin-left:40px;">
In order to display our relational database result,<br>
we are asked to set up our own website.<br>
I used Gliffy as a tool for making my wireframe diagram,<br>
according to the function(What should the website do?),<br>
appearance(Where should I put my information?/Where should I put the function button) and the flow.<br>
With the wireframe, I can clearly know the framework of the website<br>
and also easy to modify once i found any problem before setting up my website.<br>
<br>
The following is the complete website:

<br>
<strong style="font-family: Montserrat;">2. The IOS APP</strong>
<p style="font-family: Roboto Slab; margin-left:40px;">
I’m a beginner for building up IOS APP.<br>
Using Xcode to build up the app.<br>
I made a karaoke app to help others release stress.<br>
With the MVC concept of Xcode, I first dragged out some tables, buttons and text fields to design my interface.<br>
I see it as a wireframe or a storyboard to help me with my further design.<br>
Then also set up the flow to clarify the order.<br>
In the end, I’ll write the code to control the event.<br>
<br>
The following is the Storyboard of my IOS APP:

<br>
<strong style="font-family: Montserrat;">3. 3D Hologram project</strong>
<p style="font-family: Roboto Slab; margin-left:40px;">
I used 3D Hologram to do the marketing for a restaurant.<br>
I created a story using 3D Hologram and my app could interact with it.<br>
I used online cell phone mockup to draw my storyboard and match the story.<br>
Step by Step and also arranged the UI flow.<br>
<br>
The following is the Storyboard of my interactive app:
<br></br><img src="img/reply-3.png" width="700" alt=""></p>

<br>
<p style="font-family: Roboto Slab;">
About testing the design…<br>
I feel bad to say that I don’t have much testing experience for the design.<br>
But every time I complete my semifinished design, first, I see myself as a user, not a designer or developer,<br>
and try out the function to see if it works or works smoothly.<br>
Then I asked for volunteers to test my design.<br>
For receiving some feedbacks, I can improve my prototype.</p>

<br>
<h3>Thank you again and hope to hear good news from you</h3><br><br>
